COMPILING 4ti2
==============

Run the following commands with the 4ti2 directory:

    	./configure --prefix=INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY
        make
        make check
	make install-exec

The final command will install 4ti2 in a directory tree below the
INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY that you gave with the first command.  If you
omit the --prefix option, `make install' will install 4ti2 in the
/usr/local hierarchy.

You will need glpk and gmp installed first (see below).

The first command, 'make', compiles all the executables. The second
command, 'make check', runs a lot of automatic checks. This will take
a while.  If a check fails, then please notify the 4ti2 team.

You will need gcc version 3.4 or higher.

You will need an installed version of glpk (linear programming software). See
the website http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk for more information. The
version 4.7 has been tested. If you do not have glpk installed or 4ti2 cannot
find glpk, then the compilation will fail saying that it cannot find the file
"glpk.h".  If you have installed glpk but not in a location that 4ti2 finds by
default, then you will need to invoke 

	 ./configure --with-glpk=/ROOT/OF/GLPK/INSTALLATION/HIERARCHY

You will also need an installed version of gmp, The GNU MP
Bignum Library, with c++ support enabled (see http://www.swox.com/gmp/ for more
details).  Versions 4.2.1 and 4.1.4 have been tested. If you are compiling a
version of gmp from the source, make sure that you enable c++ support
(--enable-cxx configure option).  If you have
installed gmp but not in a location that 4ti2 finds by default, then you
will need to invoke
     
     ./configure --with-gmp=/ROOT/OF/GMP/INSTALLATION/HIERARCHY

If you have gmp but not with c++ support, then ./configure will
fail with an error saying that the file "gmpxx.h" cannot be found.
