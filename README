COMPILING 4ti2
==============

Run the following commands with the 4ti2 directory:

        make
        make check

You will need glpk and gmp installed first (see below).

The first command, 'make', compiles all the executables which are placed in the
4ti2/bin directory. The second command, 'make check', runs a lot of automatic
checks. This will take a while.  If a check fails, then please notify the 4ti2
team.

You will need gcc version 3.4 or higher. If you are using an earlier version,
then the arithmetic overflow checking will probably not work for the 64 bit
precision version. You can turn off overflow checking by removing the
compilation option '-ftrapv' from the makefile 'src/groebner/Makefile.inc'
or by running `make TRAPV=`.

You will need an installed version of glpk (linear programming software). See
the website http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk for more information. The
version 4.7 has been tested. If you do not have glpk installed or 4ti2 cannot
find glpk, then the compilation will fail saying that it cannot find the file
"glpk.h".  If you have installed glpk but not in a location that 4ti2 finds by
default, then you will need to change the makefile 'src/groebner/Makefile.inc'
to indicate where glpk is.

You will also need an installed version of gmp, The GNU MP
Bignum Library, with c++ support enabled (see http://www.swox.com/gmp/ for more
details).  Versions 4.2.1 and 4.1.4 have been tested. If you are compiling a
version of gmp from the source, make sure that you enable c++ support
(--enable-cxx configure option).  If you do not have a version of gmp installed,
then running 'make' *should* compile 4ti2 but without arbitrary precision
support (32 bit and 64 bit precision support will compile); the compilation will
fail with an error saying that it cannot find the file "gmp.h".  If you have
installed gmp but not in a location that 4ti2 finds by default, then you
will need to change the makefile 'src/groebner/Makefile.inc' to indicate where
gmp is.  If you have gmp but not with c++ support, then the compilation will
fail with an error saying that the file "gmpxx.h" cannot be found.
