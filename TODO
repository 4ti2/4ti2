-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains suggested improvements and bugs for the 4ti2 release 1.3.
Any improvements that are implemented and any bugs that are fixed should remain
in this file until the next release thus providing a way of keeping track of
changes from one release to another.

BUGS

NO. STATUS DESCRIPTION
----------------------
1.  FIXED  qsolve prints the file foo.qfree incorrectly. It fails to project
           out the slack variables.
2.  OPEN   The zsolve executable does not have executable permission in the
           binary distribution for linux. The other distributions need to be
           checked.
3.  FIXED  The zsolve source fails to build on some macOSX machines because the
           gcc option --shared is not supported.
4.  FIXED  The util source fails to build on some macOSX machines because the
           Makefile creates an empty library which sometimes is not allowed
           on macOSX.
5.  OPEN   graver outputs an empty foo.gra file when there are definitely
           homogeneous solutions if there is an all negative foo.sign file.

============
IMPROVEMENTS
============

NO. STATUS DESCRIPTION 
----------------------
1.  OPEN   We need a command line option for changing the output format so
           that output does not overwrite itself.
2.  OPEN   We need batch files for windows.
3.  OPEN   qsolve should handle rational input and output.
4.  OPEN   zsolve should handle rational input.
5.  OPEN   qsolve should handle inhomogeneous solutions, i.e. foo.rhs. Until
           it can handle foo.rhs it should emit an error. This depends upon
           improvement number 3.
6.  OPEN   Add the ability to output to print initial ideals.
7.  OPEN   The automatic checking should not run the long checks.  The long
           checks should be moved to a separate performance directory perhaps
           which is used primarily for performance profiling. These long
           checks probably should not be in the source distribution since they
           are quite large.
8.  OPEN   The --quiet option should probably mean that absolutely no output
           is printed to the screen.
9.  OPEN   The unbounded algorithm for groebner does not output status
           information often enough.
10. OPEN   We need an online user manual.
11. OPEN   The webpage needs to be updated so that the function descriptions
           are correct.
12. OPEN   The --help output should be complete and correct for all functions.
           The function should print all of its options as well as its input
           and output files.
13. OPEN   Add the ability to groebner to handle the foo.rel file.
14. OPEN   4ti2 needs better checking of the output status returned by glpk.
15. OPEN   Allow long options on sun machines.
