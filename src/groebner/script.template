# We look for options on the command line which indicate the level of precision
# required and we call the appropriate 4ti2 executable according to the required
# precision level. The short option is `-p' and the long option is
# `--precision', and the argument to either is one of 32, 64, or `arbitrary'.  
# The following regular expressions are not exactly correct since for example
# they allow misspellings of precision. However, they will match correctly
# formatted input and if the option is incorrectly formatted, the actual
# executable will pick up any errors.
