\chapter{4ti2 as a callable library}

%% \section{The C API}

Some portions of \FourTiTwo{} can be used as a callable library to avoid I/O
and process overhead.  It has a simple C API that closely mirrors the 
commands: \File{qsolve}, \File{rays}, \File{circuits}, \File{zsolve},
\File{hilbert}, \File{graver}.

Depending on its configuration, \FourTiTwo builds and installs several
libraries, either as static or shared libraries.

A single header file, \texttt{<4ti2/4ti2.h>}, provides the C API.
