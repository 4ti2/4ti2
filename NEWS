News in 4ti2 version 1.5.3, compared to 1.5.2:

 * Accept longer filenames.

 * Enable shared library builds on the Cygwin platform (using the
   libtool -no-undefined flag).

 * Use gnulib to provide getopt_long if not available in the
   system libraries.

 * If the C++ compiler does not have int32_t and int64_t, use int and
   long int instead.  

 * Fixed bug in lattice transformation with too few rows.  
   (Reported by Jerry James for Fedora.)

 * Fix a build failure with gcc 4.7.
   (Patch by Jerry James for Fedora.)


News in 4ti2 version 1.5.2, compared to 1.5.1:

 * Build a GMP-only 4ti2 if the C++ compiler does not have int32_t and int64_t.


News in 4ti2 version 1.5.1, compared to 1.4:

 * Fix a build problem with --enable-shared.


News in 4ti2 version 1.5, compared to 1.4:

 * Latest version of new qsolve.


News in 4ti2 version 1.4, compared to 1.3.2:

 * Portability fixes

 * New abstract C and C++ API (callable library), header files in 4ti2/

 * New implementation of zsolve in C++


News in 4ti2 version 1.3.2, compared to 1.3.1:
 
 * New build system, using GNU Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool.

   This allows 4ti2 to be built using the standard "./configure &&
   make && make install" sequence.

 * Bug fixes

 * Portability fixes (for GCC versions 4.3.x and 4.4.x)


News in 4ti2 version 1.3.1, compared to 1.2:

 * 'groebner' and 'markov' are again heavily improved.

 * 'groebner' and 'markov' allow non-homogeneous lattice ideals.

 * 'groebner' and 'markov' allow truncation.

 * There is a new function 'walk' performing a Gröbner walk.

 * There are new functions 'qsolve' and 'zsolve' for solving linear
   systems over the reals or the integers, respectively.

 * There are new functions 'rays' and 'circuits' to compute extreme
   rays and circuits.

 * The functions 'circuits' and 'graver' allow to fix certain
   orthants.

 * One may compute with projections by specifying variables to be
   ignored.

 * There is a new function 'minimize' to solve integer linear
   programs.
